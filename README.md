# Recent High/Low Alert
 
Recent High/Low Alert is a custom MT4/MT5 indicator coded by EarnForex.com. The indicator shows the maximum and minimum over the past N bars in the form of two lines directly on the main chart.

Recent High/Low Alert can issue popup, email, and notification alerts when the current price breaks above or below the min/max lines.
